# ipl-score-prediction



## 📝 Description

Predicting the thrill of victory! This project leverages data analysis and potentially machine learning (depending on the tech stack used, please provide the tech stack for a more accurate description) to forecast scores in IPL (Indian Premier League) matches. Imagine knowing which team has the upper hand before the final over! While I don't have specifics on the features used, score prediction models like this commonly use features like past performance of teams and players, current form, head-to-head records, weather conditions, and even stadium-specific data. Provide the tech stack and features used for a richer description!
